## Intro
This page is my second page for practicing html and css, and it's between easy and not too easy. The page has a logo, a nav at the bottom-left, and galley list without item title and subtitle.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly.
- make a gallery list with inline block
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)

## Notice
- commit often by git
- when building css, using padding instead of margin unless there's special situation(use img to replace text as a background)
- when using unfixed height inline block element, remember to set width and height to the element if necessary
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
- if border's color is the same with background, use padding instead of border.
