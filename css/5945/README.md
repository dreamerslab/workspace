## Intro
This page has two logos, a nav, some buttons, two sidebars, and a sifu list with images. The footer area has some links.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly. Use as many as tools to speed up the clone process.
- cut pictures from a png accurately
- make a sifu list with inline-block
- make sidebar with css float
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)

## Notice
- commit often by git from draft
- when using absolute position, remember to set the upper div position relative to make the absolute position based on the upper div
- when building css, using padding instead of margin. If want to use bg_text() and want to move the div, wrap the div with another div, and add padding to the outer div.
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
