## Intro
This page is similar to the fifth practice page. The page has a logo, description and a gallery list and a nav. The gallery list has title, logo and the there are two lines and a "more" button before and after the gallery list. There is also a mailme link. The footer So I use fifth page's html and sass code as a template to start, for speeding up the process.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly.
- use some div wrappers and put img to divs' background and use absolute position to piece together the backgrounds.
- make a gallery list with inline block
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)
- use other project's code as a template to start, start to practice modified other project's code, leave usable code and get rid of useless code

## Notice
- commit often by git
- when using absolute position, remember to set the upper div position relative to make the absolute position based on the upper div
- when using templates, remember to remove unnecessary code and files
- when building css, using padding instead of margin unless there's special situation(use img to replace text as a background)
- when using unfixed height inline block element, remember to set width and height to the element if necessary
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
