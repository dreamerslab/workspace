## Intro
This page has a logo, a nav, a block of description, three blocks of information in the main area, three blocks of information in the footer.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly. Use as many as tools to speed up the clone process.
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
-using absolute position
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)

## Notice
- commit often by git from draft
- when building css, using padding instead of margin. If want to use bg_text() and want to move the div, wrap the div with another div, and add padding to the outer div.
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
