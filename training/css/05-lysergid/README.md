## Intro
This page is not simple as 2nd practice. it's more like 1st practice,  the page has a logo, a gallery list and a nav. But the gallery list has title and content, not only has a photo.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly.
- making a gallery list with inline block
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practicing using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)
- 

## Notice
- Committing often by git
- when building css, using padding instead of margin
- when using unfixed height inline block element, remember to set width and height to the element if necessary
