## Intro
This page has a logo, a paragraph of description, a nav, three blocks of information and five blocks of informantion in the footer. The content area has three columns, and first two columns' style are the same. The third block is a gallery list.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly. Use as many as tools to speed up the clone process.
- use inline block to make gallery list
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)

## Notice
- commit often by git from draft
- when using absolute position, remember to set the upper div position relative to make the absolute position based on the upper div
- when building css, using padding instead of margin. If want to use bg_text() and want to move the div, wrap the div with another div, and add padding to the outer div.
- when using unfixed height inline block element, remember to set width and height to the element if necessary
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
