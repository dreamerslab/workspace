## Intro
This page is simple. Just put some img to background, then it's done. But making position accurate need much time.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly.
- make a page with absolute position
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (replace-text-with-dimensions)
- use other project's code as a template to start, start to practice modified other project's code, leave usable code and get rid of useless code

## Notice
- commit often by using git
- when using templates, remember to remove unnecessary code and files
- use counting to make the absolute position accurate instead of guessing
- when building css, using padding instead of margin unless there's special situation(use img to replace text as a background)
- when using unfixed height inline block element, remember to set width and height to the element if necessary
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
