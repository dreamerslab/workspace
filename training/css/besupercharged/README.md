## Intro
This page is different from other pages, it doesn't has a gallery list. The page has a logo, description and a gallery list and a nav. The content area has three columns, and every column has different style. There is a little information in the footer. I use 10th page's html and sass code as a template to start, for speeding up the process.

## To Practice
- speed and no hesitate, control myself not to deep in the detail too early, focus on making draft and modifying quickly.
- use inline block to make gallery list
- use some div wrappers and put images to divs' background.
- make a semantic html DOM with least html code
- practice using compass and the mixins built in (inline block, float, clearfix, replace-text-with-dimensions)
- use other project's code as a template to start, start to practice modified other project's code, leave usable code and get rid of useless code

## Notice
- commit often by git from draft
- when using templates, remember to remove unnecessary code and files
- when using absolute position, remember to set the upper div position relative to make the absolute position based on the upper div
- when building css, using padding instead of margin. If want to use replace-text-with-dimensions and want to move the div, wrap the div with another div, and add padding to the outer div. 
- when using unfixed height inline block element, remember to set width and height to the element if necessary
- if you want to batch compress or resize and rename png to jpg by photoshop, use file -> scripts -> image processor
